NAME
       perl-which - locate a Perl module in the user's @INC

USAGE
        $ perl-which Some::Perl::Module
        $ perl-which Some::Perl::Module Pure::AwesomeSauce Epic::Fail
        $ PERL5LIB=~/some/odd/path perl-which All::Your::Base

DESCRIPTION
       "perl-which" works much like the venerable "which" command but for finding Perl modules.

       Matches are reported on stdout.  By default, it reports all matches, one per line, in the same order as
       @INC.  If no matches are found, nothing is written to stdout.

WHY?
       Because using "perldoc -l Foo" doesn't always work:

       o   when the module doesn't have POD

       o   when the author separates the POD into its own file

       And I have to make sure it isn't "-L" instead.

       Besides, that isn't really what "perldoc" is for, right?

DEPENDENCIES
       Path::Class

BUGS
       None so far.
